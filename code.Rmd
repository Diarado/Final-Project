This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}

library(gbm)
library(caret)
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility of results
# Assuming `wine` is your dataframe
#white = 0, red = 1
wine <- wine_quality_white_and_red
wine$type <- ifelse(wine$type == "white", 0, 1)
index <- createDataPartition(wine$quality, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train_data <- wine[index, ]
test_data <- wine[-index, ]
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility of results
# Fit the model
gbm_model <- gbm(quality ~ ., data = train_data, 
                 distribution = "gaussian",
                 n.trees = 500, # Number of trees
                 interaction.depth = 3, # Depth of each tree
                 shrinkage = 0.01, # Learning rate
                 cv.folds = 5, # Number of cross-validation folds
                 n.minobsinnode = 10 # Minimum number of observations in the nodes
)
# Perform cross-validation
cv_model <- gbm.perf(gbm_model, method = "cv")
best_trees <- gbm_model$n.trees[cv_model]
# Predict using the test set
# Predict using the test set
predictions <- predict(gbm_model, test_data, n.trees = gbm_model$best.iteration)
# Evaluate model performance
postResample(pred = predictions, obs = test_data$quality)

# Dimension reduction

# Get the importance data from the model
importance <- summary(gbm_model)
imp <- data.frame(importance)
